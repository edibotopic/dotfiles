# Custom palettes

These are custom palettes in base 16, which I like to use in ptyxis terminal.

I use them with Helix, where I set the the editor theme to `base16_terminal`.

The colour palette is then common to the terminal and the editor, and both
integrate with GNOME's dark/light switch.

## Available palettes

* Artdeco
* Plain

# Usage

Copy the palettes to:

```
~/.local/share/org.gnome.Ptyxis/palettes/
```

Alternatively, drag the palette file onto the terminal.
